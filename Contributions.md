  * Tutorials on how to use map editor and utility tools

## Translations ##

The project always needs translations into new languages, improving existing translations. If your language is not in the game yet, please contact us and we can discuss adding it. It might require a new font set (see below). If the translation in your language is incomplete or has mistakes, please contact us.

## Fonts ##

KaM uses bitmap style fonts, meaning they must be custom made for new font sets. You edit the font as an image exported from the FontEditor in e.g. Photoshop and put the characters into the correct place on a grid.
We would especially like these fonts to be made due to demand:
  * Greek (Windows-1253)

Note: We currently only support 8 bit fonts, (not Unicode/UTF) so that means languages like Chinese, Japanese, etc. are not possible yet. We have plans for some kind of Unicode support in the future.

## Maintenance ##

Track and file all bugreports into bugtracker (Google.Code Issues)

## Website Translations ##

Our website [www.kamremake.com](http://www.kamremake.com) is automatically translated by Google Translate, and can then be improved by volunteers. If you want to improve a translation please contact us.

## Beta Testing ##

Before every release we send private "beta" versions of the game to our playtesters to find bugs and mistakes that we missed. Due to the complex nature of the game many bugs can only be found by playing for hours, which we do not have time to do. If you want to join our quality assurance team please contact us and we'll add you to our mailing list.

## Promotion ##

Spread the word, tell your friends, post it around the internet! We want to attract as many players as possible.
